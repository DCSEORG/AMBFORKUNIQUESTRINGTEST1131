create a zip file for the app code so that it can be deployed to azure in the following manner:

az webapp deploy \
  --resource-group MyRG \
  --name MyWebApp \
  --src-path ./app.zip

Also add the correct terminal command to any deployment scripts you are creating or have created to deploy it.

Make sure the app.zip folder unzips to give app folder that has dll file inside it,
do not add another folder level in between like publish folder or other.
