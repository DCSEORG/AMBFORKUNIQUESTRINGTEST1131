create a second deploy.sh file that will just deploy the genai services needed for the chat ui. 
To be clear we will have a deploy.sh that deploys any db and app then a deploy-chatui.sh that deploys the genai bicep files.
Make sure the deploy-chatui file sets the environment variables from the genai resources created earlier (OpenAI endpoint and model, also Cognitive Services/Search endpoint)
